The file `index.html` in the `build` folder is ready to be viewed, as it is required in the assignment. It doesn't require any dependencies.

The project is done with CRA. In case you would want to run dev version, 

```
npm i
npm run start
```

will listen on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm run test` will run tests for mathematical functions. I think, interfaces should rather be tested in integration suites, with something like Cypress or Selenium. However, it's not the point of the task.
